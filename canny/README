Canny edge detection using python and scipy
Author:			Vishwanath
Dependencies:	numpy, scipy, Python Image Library (optional)

This module will implement canny edge detection.

Usage:
>>> from Canny import Canny
>>> canny = Canny('bike.jpg', sigma = 0.85)
>>> imout = canny.grad
>>> imout.show() # Use this only if Python Image Library is installed

Note:
1. The code is not very fast
2. Improvements are welcome
