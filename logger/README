Usage:

Let us assume that you would like to create you logging file in /home/me and your
logging file will be called logger

1. $ cd /home/me
2. $ log init logger

If the present month is May, then a file called logger_May will be created.

Now you can start logging. Let us log our first message, 'My very first log'

$ log -m 'My very first log'

To view you present month logs,

$ log view

Thats it! Happy logging!
